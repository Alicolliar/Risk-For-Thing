# LEX Risk Thing

## Overview

This is a thing that is meant to calculate risk for stocks in the Nationstates-based stock exchange, LEX, or Land's End Stock Exchange. It calculates risk using a multitude of factors based on previous price rangers and uses that to form a "risk score" from 0 to 40, a higher number represents more risk. The project is still ongoing, and isn't all that good thus far, so please be kind.
