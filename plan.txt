So, right

- A clients portfolio is assigned a "risk" percentage out of 100, higher = more risky, lower = less risky
- Each "asset" in the client portfolio is, equally, assigned a rating out of 40

- 2 metrics are used to determine risk
  - Standard Deviation - A standard volatility measure, no worries, piece of piss to calculate
    - 15 points, where each 0.67% std dev rises, it rises 1 point
  - Beta - A much more interesting measure that measures volatility relative to the rest of the market,
      a bit harder to calculate
  (at least, a bit more computing needed on mine and Aug's end, so, yeeeaaah) - 25 points, for every 0.01 the beta rises above 1, a point is added

- Charge, what, 500 Lex for the first few calc runs, see how that goes

Update Beta data once a month
